Here, the implementation is based on the general DIRECT implementation in the R package bootfs [1]. The DIRECT code
in that package is in turn a re-implementation in R of a Matlab code developed in [2]. We also use a function from R/QTL for
calculating the probabilites [3]. The "hyper" data is from R/QTL package [3].
